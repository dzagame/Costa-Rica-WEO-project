A simple project I conducted for my MA class in Econometrics using data for Costa Rica from the IMF's World Economic Outlook.

## How to run

Download the entire project. Then, simply run the R script included in the "r_file" folder, making sure to change the working directory.

## Directory
The "in_data" folder contains the most updated WEO data at the time of writing.
The "r_file" folder contains the script that has to be run.
The "out_data" folder contains the resulting graphs.
